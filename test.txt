BENNETT READ SUPERCHEF 6 INTELLIGENT MULTI-COOKER

The "I don't want to think about cooking tonight" machine

This appliance is basically seven kitchen tools rolled into one smart, safe pot.
It replaces:
- A pot
- A pan
- A slow cooker
- A rice cooker
- A steamer
- A pressure cooker
- A yoghurt maker

And it does so WITHOUT BABYSITTING.

The SuperChef 6 controls temperature, pressure, and time automatically. Your job is simply to:
1. Add ingredients
2. Choose a program
3. Press Start

That's it. The machine does the rest.

SAFETY FIRST — Why This Thing Is Hard to Mess Up

Before getting into buttons and cooking, here's why it's safe:
- The lid LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY when under pressure
- It WILL NOT OPEN if there's pressure inside
- If pressure is too high, it releases steam on its own
- If you forget about it, it switches to KEEP-WARM, not burn mode

This isn't an old-school pressure cooker that explodes if you look at it wrong.
It's designed to PROTECT THE USER FIRST, FOOD SECOND.

BEFORE THE FIRST USE (Once-Only Setup)

This is just to get it ready:

1. Take out the INNER POT, lid, measuring cup, and spoon
2. Wash them with warm soapy water
3. Dry everything
4. Wipe the outside of the main unit with a cloth

Check two things on the lid:
- The RUBBER SEALING RING is seated properly
- The PRESSURE VALVE moves freely

Once that's done, you never need to do this again.

STEP-BY-STEP: Cooking Anything Without Stress

STEP 1: Loading the Food

- Open the lid by turning it COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
- Put ingredients directly into the INNER POT
- Always add SOME LIQUID (water, stock, sauce)

Important rules:
- Never fill past the MAX line
- For foods that expand (rice, beans, soup): only fill 2/3 full
- Wipe the OUTSIDE BOTTOM of the pot before placing it back in

Put the pot back into the cooker — it should sit flat.

---

STEP 2: Closing & Sealing (This Is the Key Part)

- Close the lid and turn it CLOCKWISE until it locks
- Turn the pressure valve on top to "SEALED"

If the valve isn't sealed:
- It won't build pressure
- It won't cook correctly
- Nothing dangerous happens — it just won't start properly

Think of "Sealed" as "COOK MODE".

---

STEP 3: Choosing a Program (The Brain of the Machine)

Plug it in. The display shows 00:00.

Now press ONE BUTTON based on what you're cooking:
- Rice
- Soup / Stew
- Meat / Poultry
- Bean / Mince
- Steam
- Yoghurt
- Sauté

Each program already knows:
- How hot to go
- How much pressure to use
- How long it usually needs

You can adjust time with +/-, but you don't have to.

Press START.

If you don't press Start within about 20 seconds, it just goes back to standby — nothing breaks.

---

WHAT HAPPENS WHILE IT'S COOKING

This is where people get confused — so here's the truth:

- The timer DOES NOT START IMMEDIATELY
- First, it heats up and builds pressure
- Once pressure is reached, the FLOAT VALVE POPS UP
- THEN the countdown starts

So if it says 12 minutes but feels longer — that's normal.
The machine is warming up and doing safety checks.

During cooking:
- Don't open the lid
- Don't touch the valve
- You can walk away completely

---

WHEN IT'S DONE

When cooking finishes:
- It beeps
- The screen shows "bb"
- It automatically switches to KEEP-WARM

Your food is done. Now you release pressure.

---

RELEASING PRESSURE (Two Safe Options)

OPTION 1: NATURAL RELEASE (Recommended for most meals)

- Do nothing
- Pressure slowly drops on its own
- Float valve drops down
- Lid unlocks naturally

Best for:
- Rice
- Soups
- Stews
- Beans
- Meat

---

OPTION 2: QUICK RELEASE (When You're in a Hurry)

- Carefully turn the valve to "EXHAUST"
- Hot steam shoots out (hands away!)
- Once steam stops and float valve drops → safe to open

Best for:
- Vegetables
- Steaming
- When you don't want food to overcook

If the lid doesn't open easily — DON'T FORCE IT.
It means pressure is still inside.

---

AFTER COOKING — Warm & Serve

The SuperChef keeps food warm automatically.
- It won't overcook
- It won't burn
- You can serve when ready

You can also turn Keep Warm on or off manually.

---

DELAY START (Optional, but Powerful)

You can set cooking to start UP TO 24 HOURS LATER.
Each press adds 30 minutes.

Good for:
- Rice
- Stews
- Dried beans

Not good for:
- Raw meat sitting out too long
- Dairy

Common sense applies.

---

CLEANING (Simple & Fast)

- Inner pot: wash like a normal pot
- Lid: remove and rinse sealing ring occasionally
- Main unit: WIPE ONLY, never submerge

Dry lid parts fully before storing to avoid smells.

QUICK REFERENCE COOKING TIMES

Function          | Approx Time
===============================================
Rice              | ~12 minutes
Soup / Stew       | ~35 minutes
Meat / Poultry    | ~15 minutes
Beans / Mince     | ~40 minutes
Steam             | ~10 minutes
Yoghurt           | ~8 hours
Sauté             | ~5 minutes

Times can be adjusted, but these work well for everyday meals.
