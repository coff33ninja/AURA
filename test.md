## 🍲 Bennett Read SuperChef 6 Intelligent Multi-Cooker

**The “I don’t want to think about cooking tonight” machine**

This appliance is basically **seven kitchen tools rolled into one smart, safe pot**.
It replaces:

* A pot
* A pan
* A slow cooker
* A rice cooker
* A steamer
* A pressure cooker
* A yoghurt maker

And it does so **without babysitting**.

The SuperChef 6 controls **temperature, pressure, and time automatically**. Your job is simply to:

1. Add ingredients
2. Choose a program
3. Press Start

That’s it. The machine does the rest.

## 🔥 Safety First — Why This Thing Is Hard to Mess Up

Before getting into buttons and cooking, here’s why it’s safe:

* The lid **locks automatically** when under pressure
* It **will not open** if there’s pressure inside
* If pressure is too high, it releases steam on its own
* If you forget about it, it switches to **keep-warm**, not burn mode

This isn’t an old-school pressure cooker that explodes if you look at it wrong.
It’s designed to **protect the user first, food second**.

---

## 🧼 Before the First Use (Once-Only Setup)

This is just to get it ready:

1. Take out the **inner pot**, lid, measuring cup, and spoon
2. Wash them with warm soapy water
3. Dry everything
4. Wipe the outside of the main unit with a cloth

Check two things on the lid:

* The **rubber sealing ring** is seated properly
* The **pressure valve** moves freely

Once that’s done, you never need to do this again.

## 🥕 Step-by-Step: Cooking Anything Without Stress

### 1️⃣ Loading the Food

* Open the lid by turning it **counter-clockwise**
* Put ingredients directly into the **inner pot**
* Always add **some liquid** (water, stock, sauce)

Important rules:

* Never fill past the **MAX line**
* For foods that expand (rice, beans, soup): only fill **⅔ full**
* Wipe the **outside bottom** of the pot before placing it back in

Put the pot back into the cooker — it should sit flat.

---

### 2️⃣ Closing & Sealing (This Is the Key Part)

* Close the lid and turn it **clockwise until it locks**
* Turn the pressure valve on top to **“Sealed”**

If the valve isn’t sealed:

* It won’t build pressure
* It won’t cook correctly
* Nothing dangerous happens — it just won’t start properly

Think of “Sealed” as **“cook mode”**.

---

### 3️⃣ Choosing a Program (The Brain of the Machine)

Plug it in. The display shows **00:00**.

Now press **one button** based on what you’re cooking:

* Rice
* Soup / Stew
* Meat / Poultry
* Bean / Mince
* Steam
* Yoghurt
* Sauté

Each program already knows:

* How hot to go
* How much pressure to use
* How long it usually needs

You can adjust time with **+ / –**, but you don’t have to.

Press **START**.

If you don’t press Start within about 20 seconds, it just goes back to standby — nothing breaks.

---

## ⏳ What Happens While It’s Cooking

This is where people get confused — so here’s the truth:

* The timer **does not start immediately**
* First, it heats up and builds pressure
* Once pressure is reached, the **float valve pops up**
* THEN the countdown starts

So if it says 12 minutes but feels longer — that’s normal.
The machine is warming up and doing safety checks.

During cooking:

* Don’t open the lid
* Don’t touch the valve
* You can walk away completely

---

## 🔔 When It’s Done

When cooking finishes:

* It beeps
* The screen shows **“bb”**
* It automatically switches to **keep-warm**

Your food is done. Now you release pressure.

---

## 💨 Releasing Pressure (Two Safe Options)

### 🕰 Natural Release (Recommended for most meals)

* Do nothing
* Pressure slowly drops on its own
* Float valve drops down
* Lid unlocks naturally

Best for:

* Rice
* Soups
* Stews
* Beans
* Meat

---

### ⚡ Quick Release (When You’re in a Hurry)

* Carefully turn the valve to **“Exhaust”**
* Hot steam shoots out (hands away!)
* Once steam stops and float valve drops → safe to open

Best for:

* Vegetables
* Steaming
* When you don’t want food to overcook

If the lid doesn’t open easily — **don’t force it**.
It means pressure is still inside.

---

## 🍽 After Cooking — Warm & Serve

The SuperChef keeps food warm automatically.

* It won’t overcook
* It won’t burn
* You can serve when ready

You can also turn **Keep Warm** on or off manually.

---

## ⏱ Delay Start (Optional, but Powerful)

You can set cooking to start **up to 24 hours later**.
Each press adds **30 minutes**.

Good for:

* Rice
* Stews
* Dried beans

Not good for:

* Raw meat sitting out too long
* Dairy

Common sense applies.

---

## 🧼 Cleaning (Simple & Fast)

* Inner pot: wash like a normal pot
* Lid: remove and rinse sealing ring occasionally
* Main unit: **wipe only**, never submerge

Dry lid parts fully before storing to avoid smells.
